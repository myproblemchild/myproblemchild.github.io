<p>Antonio Vivaldi was an Italian classical composer and a violin virtuoso.
<p>He was born on March 4, 1678 - almost exactly 7 years before birth of Bach, and died on July 28, 1741 - <b>exactly</b> 9 years before death of Bach.
<p>Vivaldi was famous and successful but after his music fell out of fashion he had to seek financial support.
  Planning on such a support from Charles VI Holy Roman Emperor Vivaldi left Venice and moved to Vienna. However soon after that Charles VI died.
<p>Less than 1 year after that Vivaldi died in poverty and his valuables were confiscated to pay off his debts.

<p>Vivaldi's music was forgotten until XXth century.
